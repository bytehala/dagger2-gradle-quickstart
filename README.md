### dagger2-gradle-quickstart
A simple Dagger 2 tutorial, with instructions in the commit messages. The commits will build up from a template, to full functionality without dependency injection, eventually using Dagger 2 in the end.

Issues, pull requests, and forks are encouraged.

#### Learning Resources
I find the explanations here to be very helpful: http://fernandocejas.com/2015/04/11/tasting-dagger-2-on-android/


#### FAQ

> Where is DaggerApplicationComponent? Your sample doesn't have it and I cannot even build your sample project!
  * Please wait for the project to build, or build it manually. Dagger 2 uses code generation to do its DI black magic.
